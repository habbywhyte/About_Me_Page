	<h1>About Me...</h1>
	<p>Hi there, my name is Habby and I have no idea how I ended up here (meaning the world of technology) but geesh!...what took me so long?  I have always had an affinity for all things creative, but I just didn't know how to apply it until it just hit me!
	<p>I'm a creative thinker, and you can usually find me tinkering with colors, images, shapes, fonts, and text placements...etc.  I find beauty (and power!) in how they work in concert to inspire an action or a feeling.</p>
	<p>I'm a mom of two beautiful, very lively young girls and they are what keep me motivated to achieve all things possible. I want them to see their mom as a strong example of a woman who isn't afraid to take risks and to follow her dream.  I want the chance to transform the lives of women and girls everywhere- to become enlightened, inspired and turned on through and by technology.</p>
